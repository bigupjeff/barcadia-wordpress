# Barcadia V2 Starter - WordPress Mashup

### Intentions

- Take this GatsbyJS starter theme, and transplant WordPress in place of Contentful.
- Keep sourcing as simple as Contenful.
- Keep the theme as close to it's OG as possible.



# Anything below this line is a work in progress, not ready for use!

**Prerequisites**

 - Have a WordPress installation running and accessible via http to use as a data source.


### Setup the Gatsby WP Source plugin

'npm install gatsby-source-wordpress'

There are some helpful notes regarding gatsby-source-wordpress on the npjms.com page
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-wordpress/v/3.10.0-next.1).

Configure the plugin in `gatsby-config.js` with **url** as a bare minimum:
```
plugins: [
	{
		resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress`,
		options: {
			url: "https://source.wp-website/graphql",
			// Search and Replace Urls across WordPress content. For use if your WP instance is at a
			// different URL to the dev/production envs.
			searchAndReplaceContentUrls: {
				sourceUrl: "https://source.wp-website",
				replacementUrl: "https://gatsby.wp-website",
			},
		},
	},
],
```

### Setup WPGatsby and WPGraphQL Plugins in WordPress

Search for, install and activate these on the WP plugin page:

 - WP GraphQL
 - WP Gatsby


### Page Creation

Files in pages/* that are named {something}.js are "collection route components" for Gatsby File System Route API. Gatsby automatically infers a page/post schema using data from WP (or other sources), and creates a query from the filepath/name to build pages from that schema.

These components are automatically passed two dynamic variables, the id and URL of each page node. These can be accessed from within the component as
 - props.params (URL)
 - props.pageContext.id (ID)

Both are also passed as variables to the componentâ€™s GraphQL query, so you can query fields from the node.

This means you don't need to worry about querying all posts/pages before passing to a page template.
